"Once you're in the group, you're in the group.  Sponsorship and "
"Administrators typically have special access in the group in questions.  "
"Some groups consider sponsorship level to be of a higher involvement, "
"partial ownership of the group for example.  But as far as the account "
"system goes the distinction is easy.  Sponsors can approve new users and "
"make people into sponsors.  They cannot, however, downgrade or remove other "
"sponsors.  They also cannot change administrators in any way.  "
"Administrators can do anything to anyone in the group."
