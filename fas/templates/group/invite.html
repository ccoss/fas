          ${person.human_name} &lt;<a href="mailto: ${person.email}">${person.email}</a>&gt; has invited you to join the Fedora
          Project!  We are a community of users and developers who produce a
          complete operating system from entirely free and open source software
          (FOSS).  ${person.human_name} thinks that you have knowledge and skills
          that make you a great fit for the Fedora community, and that you might
          be interested in contributing.
          </p>
          <p>
          How could you team up with the Fedora community to use and develop your
          skills?  Check out http://fedoraproject.org/join-fedora for some ideas.
          Our community is more than just software developers -- we also have a
          place for you whether you're an artist, a web site builder, a writer, or
          a people person.  You'll grow and learn as you work on a team with other
          very smart and talented people.
          </p>
          <p>
          Fedora and FOSS are changing the world -- come be a part of it!
